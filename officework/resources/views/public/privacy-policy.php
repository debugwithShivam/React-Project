  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <p>We use information to create accounts, process orders and bookings, verify prescriptions, assign zones, route support and complaints, display relevant inventory, send notifications, manage refunds and wallet credits, maintain financial and operational ledgers, prevent fraud or abuse, secure the platform and comply with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>Legal basis and consent</h2>
  <p>Where required, we ask for permission before accessing sensitive information such as location, camera, file uploads or notifications. Users may deny permissions, but some features may not work without them. Prescription uploads and medical information should be submitted only when needed for a medicine order or pharmacy review.</p>

  <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>Information may be shared with the relevant vendor, provider, hotel, restaurant, real estate agent, delivery partner, payment provider, notification provider, hosting provider, support team, auditors, professional advisers, regulators or legal authorities when necessary for platform operation, dispute resolution, safety, fraud prevention or legal compliance.

  <h2>Payments and wallets</h2>
  <p>Payment information may be processed by configured payment gateways or recorded as manual payment references. Wallet balances, refunds, withdrawals and transaction ledgers are retained for audit, fraud prevention and accounting purposes.</p>

  <h2>Medical privacy</h2>
  <p>Prescription documents and health-related order details are sensitive. They should be accessed only by authorized pharmacy/admin personnel for review, fulfillment, support, dispute handling and record keeping. Users must not upload false prescriptions or documents belonging to another person without lawful authority.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use access controls, role-based panels, HTTPS hosting, validation, rate limiting and operational safeguards to reduce unauthorized access. No system is completely risk-free, so users and partners should keep credentials secure and immediately report suspicious activity.</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain account, order, booking, invoice, payment, prescription, support, complaint, audit and settlement records as long as needed for service delivery, legal compliance, accounting, dispute handling, fraud prevention and legitimate business operations.

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in law, platform features, modules or business operations. Continued use after an update means the updated policy applies.</p>
